## Project Overview

This project provides a complete solution for controlling home appliances wirelessly. The system is designed to be user-friendly and easy to integrate with existing home appliances.

## Repository Structure

- **circuit design**: Contains the circuit diagrams and schematics for the wireless control system.
- **product design (3D design)**: Includes 3D design files for enclosures and other physical components.
- **firmware**: Contains the source code for the embedded microcontroller, developed in **Keil C51**.

## Circuit Design

![Circuit Diagram](circuit%20design/circuit_diagram.png)

This folder includes circuit diagrams essential for the operation of the wireless control system. The diagrams show the connection layout for the microcontroller, wireless module, and appliance control mechanisms.

## Product Design (3D)

![3D Enclosure](product%20design%20(3D%20design)/enclosure_design.png)

This folder includes 3D design files for the physical components, such as enclosures and holders, that house the electronics. The designs are optimized for easy assembly and protection of components.

## Firmware

The firmware folder contains the embedded C code used to operate the AT89C51 microcontroller for controlling the appliance based on wireless signals.
