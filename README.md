## Project Overview

This project provides a complete solution for controlling home appliances wirelessly. The system is designed to be user-friendly and easy to integrate with existing home appliances.

## Repository Structure

- **circuit design**: Contains the circuit diagrams and schematics for the wireless control system.
- **product design (3D design)**: Includes 3D design files for enclosures and other physical components.
- **firmware**: Contains the source code for the embedded microcontroller, developed in **Keil C51**.

## Circuit Design
